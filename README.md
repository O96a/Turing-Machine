# Turing-Machine
A computing device that was introduced in the 1930s by Alan Turing as a way of studying computation and its limitations.

A Turing machine works on a "tape" that is used for both input and output. The tape is made up of little squares called cells lined up in a horizontal row that stretches, conceptually, off to infinity in both directions. Each cell can hold one character. Initially, the content of a cell is a blank space. One cell on the tape is considered to be the current cell. This is the cell where the machine is located. As a Turing machine computes, it moves back and forth along the tape, and the current cell changes.
